## Game Structure
The game is structured as a Python script with a single file. Hereâ€™s how it works:
1. The `show_menu` function displays the game menu.
2. The main game loop handles player inputs, enemy spawns, and game mechanics.
3. Collision detection checks if bullets hit enemies, power-ups are collected, and boss interactions.
4. The `draw_objects` function renders the player, bullets, enemies, and power-ups on the screen.
5. The game tracks player health, score, and level, and handles game over scenarios.
